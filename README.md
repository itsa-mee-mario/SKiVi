Shrey's Keys and Values is a simple key-value store and pub/sub system meant to be used on a secure network with multiple IoT/edge devices that don't directly interact with each other.  uses sockets.io, so writing clients in other languages like JS or C is super easy barely an inconvenience.



Run the server scipt on a device and the client script on the other device(s) and change the code to add the relevant details (ip address, rooms to sub to)
